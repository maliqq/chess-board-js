# Project context

This is a chess board that shows popular openings.

## Data
In `dat/` there are *.tsv files with moves for every known opening.

## UX
1. User starts with white, picks any pawn move and sees the name of opening,
2. Board is flipped, hovering over every black pawn shows possible opening paths
3. User makes move for black, board is flipped again
4. Arrows are showed for most popular moves for white
5. And then everything is repeated until the end of the known opening variation

## TODO
* winning chances for every variation for White/Black
